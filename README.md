## Title of the Project
StrongBones : Cracking the Silent Disease
## About

StrongBones: Cracking the Silent Disease is a deep learning–based medical image analysis project developed to detect and classify bone health conditions such as Normal, Osteopenia, and Osteoporosis using radiological images. Osteoporosis is often called a silent disease because bone loss occurs without symptoms until a fracture happens.

This project aims to assist healthcare professionals by providing an automated, accurate, and efficient diagnostic support system. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and transfer learning models, the system analyzes medical images to identify early-stage bone density loss, enabling timely intervention and improved patient outcomes.

## Features
